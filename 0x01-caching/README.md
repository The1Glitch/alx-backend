0x01. Caching
Description
This project explores the concept of caching, a technique used to store and retrieve data faster by keeping a copy of frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area (cache). The aim is to improve the performance and efficiency of applications by reducing the time it takes to access data.

Objectives
Understand the importance and benefits of caching.

Implement different caching mechanisms.

Learn about various cache replacement policies.

Usage
To use the caching implementations in this project, run the appropriate scripts based on the caching mechanism you wish to test. Detailed instructions for each mechanism are provided in their respective directories.

Cache Mechanisms
The project covers several caching mechanisms, including but not limited to:

In-Memory Caching: Storing data directly in memory for quick access.

Distributed Caching: Using a distributed system to cache data across multiple nodes.

Database Caching: Caching query results to speed up database access.

Cache Replacement Policies
This project also explores various cache replacement policies, such as:

Least Recently Used (LRU): Removes the least recently accessed items first.

First In First Out (FIFO): Removes the oldest items first.

Least Frequently Used (LFU): Removes items that are accessed the least often.
